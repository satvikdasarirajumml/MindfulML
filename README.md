This repository contains a statistics and machine learning analysis pipeline that seeks to answer 2 questions: 
(1) What precludes a tech employee from discussing mental health issues in the workplace? 
(2) What factors deter a tech employee from seeking treatment for mental health. 

Please see our open letter to tech companies for contextualization and a detailed description of the methodology.
